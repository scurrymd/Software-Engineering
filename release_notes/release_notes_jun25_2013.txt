UC Schedule:

June 25 2013:



• Fixed MainActivity UI bugs.

Comments:


1. Continue working on interfacing to the calendar
2. Continue to do code reviews, document/comment any code you write, start writing test cases (write tests-before-you-code)


I expect to see some progress/update on the database front. Good luck! Nice job on the test plan.
