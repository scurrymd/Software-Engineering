o added Software requirements document
o added release notes document


Comments:

1. Change app name to a single word that reflects the functionality or use of the app. 
2. Rewrite objectives in the requirements documents as discussed during our lab meeting
4. Rewrite "statement of functionality".
3. Research on other apps that are similar to yours and update the requirements document under "replacement of legacy systems"
