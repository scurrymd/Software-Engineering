Requirements Document:
1.What does "The development cycle will consist of multiple phases depending what deadlines are given" mean (under scope)? Include what those phases are, various tasks involved and milestones.
2. "This app will possibly be integrated into the UC Mobile app" What is UC Mobile app? What are its capablities? How does your app fit in to UC Mobile app?

Next steps:
1. You should get access to the UC's student database ASAP! It's going to be hard to deliver the project on-time, if you don't get this resource by the next release.
2. Write unit test cases for modules you have implemented so far (use user stories to identify test scenarios).Specifically, Write unit tests for the layout issues that you are currently facing.
3. Henceforth, Write unit test cases before you implement a module/scenario. 
4. Document/Include comments to .xml files. Continue documenting java source files. 

Keep up the good work. Meet frequently, brainstorm and code as a TEAM!
