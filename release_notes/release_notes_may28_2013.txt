UC Schedule:

May 28 2013:



• Changed app name to "UC Schedule"
• Added login Page
• Updated "Objectives" to fill a need.
• Updated "State of Functionality".
• Updated "Replacement for Legacy System".

Comments:

Requirements document:
1. Explore features of UCMobile App and update "replacement of legacy systems" as discussed (your app as a possible integrated feature in UCMobile app)
2. Include a description of UCIT's role and resources that you anticipate to use, under the "Business process" section
3. Include an Appendix with information about API and other resources that you collect (example: API for UC database)
4. Include an Appendix with a list of contact information from UCIT and other external collaborators.
5. Update the table of contents

Specification document:
1. In the use-case diagram, the UC database could be another possible actor. Use appropriate syntax (correct arrows, <include>, <extend> as neccessary) to associate different use cases

Next steps (Implementation):
1. Start working on creating a user interface for various activities. Besides the login screen, what other activities do you need? 
2. Research on Possible API for using the UC database

Misc:
1. The App name may still need to be changed into a "single word". Something creative! We don't need it right away but keep thinking, and update it whenever you have one.


Good work on getting in touch with UCIT. Building relationships with collaborators is key to solving engineering problems!
